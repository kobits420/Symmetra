npm start
```

That's it! No AI to configure, no API keys needed.

## Using the App

### Step 1: Learn the Syntax

Click the **📖 Guide button** in the top bar or press **F1** to open the comprehensive syntax guide with live examples!

### Step 2: Type Your Notes

Use the structured syntax. Examples:

```
# My Math Notes

The derivative of x squared is:
derivative of x squared with respect to x

Which simplifies to 2x.

Theorem: The integral from 0 to infinity of e to the power of negative x equals 1.

Proof: We use substitution...
End proof
```

### Step 3: Watch It Convert

After 0.5 seconds of inactivity, your text converts to LaTeX instantly!

### Step 4: Save

Press **Ctrl+S** to save as a `.tex` file.

## Common Patterns

**Powers:**
- `x squared` → x²
- `x cubed` → x³
- `x to the power of 5` → x⁵

**Fractions:**
- `a over b` → a/b

**Calculus:**
- `integral from 0 to 5 of x` → ∫₀⁵ x dx
- `derivative of f with respect to x` → df/dx
- `sum from i=1 to n` → Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ

**Greek:**
- `alpha`, `beta`, `pi`, `theta`, etc.

**Symbols:**
- `infinity` → ∞
- `not equal to` → ≠

## Tips

1. **Press F1** or click 📖 for the complete syntax guide with rendered examples
2. Conversions are instant (< 0.01 seconds)
3. Structure your text clearly - use `#` for headings
4. Use `Theorem:` and `Proof:` for math environments
5. Toggle between rendered view and LaTeX code with the button

## Why No AI?

Symmetra uses **pattern matching** instead of AI:
- ⚡ Instant results (no 10-30 second wait)
- 🎯 Consistent output every time
- 💰 Completely free
- 🔒 100% private
- 🚀 Super lightweight

You learn the patterns quickly, and then you're faster than AI!

Enjoy taking beautiful math notes!
